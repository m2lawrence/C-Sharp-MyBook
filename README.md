In just 21 days readers will learn how to use the key features of the C# programming language¿not only the commands, but how to create entire programs using them within a few simple chapters. This book is designed to teach C# from the ground up¿each lesson is built to supplement the chapter before to provide a fully rounded understanding of the C# language. Sams Teach Yourself the C# Language in 21 Days is the only book on the market that takes C# out of the Microsoft Visual Studio and teaches it as a platform-independent language¿letting readers program for Windows, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. Additional coverage added from the first edition: more and better Windows Forms information, database access, XML, types, runs, appendix for Visual C++ .NET users, plus much more. This book also includes a CD-ROM full of third-party editor software and sample code, making it an easy-to-use, all-in-one package.
